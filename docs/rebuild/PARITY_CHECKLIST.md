# PARITY_CHECKLIST — every Tasker artifact, tracked to disposition

Statuses: `pending` → `ported` (with target) / `dropped(reason)` → `device-verified` (human, Gates).
Segments flip rows they own; S14 enforces zero `pending`; the human flips to `device-verified`.
XML anchors: profiles/scenes verified line numbers (see XML_RECIPES.md R4/R5/R7); task anchors
filled by S1/S2 during extraction.

## Profiles (18)

> S1 extracted profiles 753–761, 769 → `extraction/profiles.md` (context+gate+enter/exit+pri). Profiles 762–768, 8 are S2. Status stays `pending` until ported to Kotlin (S9+).

## Pipeline & feature task clusters (~25)

> S1 transcribed the core-pipeline tasks (554, 544, 535, 546, 661, 548, 659, 543, 696, 698, 700, 618, 585, 566, 567, 569, 561, 528, 570, 645–654, 644, 551, 584) → `extraction/tasks/*.md` + `pipeline_spec.md` + `defaults_audit.md`. Status stays `pending` until ported (S4–S9). Non-pipeline clusters (90, 43/contexts, 38/655, 524, 592/637/622, debug, misc UI) are S2.

## Scenes (20) → M3 screens (~9, per S2 screen_map.md)

> S2 extracted all 20 scenes → `extraction/scenes/*.md` (450-element tables) + `screen_map.md` (full disposition matrix). 'Ported to' = target M3 screen; Status `pending` until rendered (S11–S13).
