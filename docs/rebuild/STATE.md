# STATE — cross-session memory for the rebuild program

Every session: read this first; append/update before your final commit. Keep entries terse and
factual. This file is the ONLY shared memory between sessions — if it isn't written here, the
next session does not know it.

## Segment log

| Segment | Date | Model | Status | Commit | Notes |

Pre-existing compile bugs fixed (D-019). :app:assembleDebug ✅ :platform:test ✅ :app:lintDebug ✅; :domain:test 4/5 pass (1 pre-existing parity failure — rapidLuxSpike, D-019, S4/S5 fix). |

Status values: DONE · PARTIAL · BLOCKED (see failure protocol in CLAUDE.md).

## Current state

S1 + S2 + S3 DONE. Build is now GREEN: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :platform:test :app:lintDebug`
all pass. APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` (28 MB). Gradle 8.14.3 wrapper
committed; version catalog at `gradle/libs.versions.toml`; :platform is now an Android library;
:data retired. One pre-existing domain test failure remains (`rapidLuxSpike_isSmoothedByTaskerFormula`
— engine parity bug per D-019, not a new regression). S4 is now unblocked.

## Next up

- S4 (Opus/medium) — Tasker reference implementation + golden vectors. Preconditions: S1 DONE ✅, S3 DONE ✅.
- S5 (Sonnet/high) after S4.
- S6 ∥ S7 ∥ S8 (parallel window B) after S5.

## Deviations & discoveries ledger

Seeded by the S0 audit (details in CLAUDE.md "Facts & corrections ledger"):

- D-001: Java blocks are action code 474 (40), not 598. (Affects S1.)
- D-002: task661 has no Java; curve math is in Variable Set expressions. task663's Java is a
  plot-side copy for cross-validation only. (Affects S1, S4.)
- D-003: Profile-level ConditionLists carry pipeline gating (prof760: absolute thresholds,
  sensor-accuracy trust, %AAB_MainLoop). (Affects S1, S9.)
- D-004: AabSettings schema gaps: %AAB_AnimSteps, %AAB_MaxSteps, %AAB_ThreshMidpoint;
  AnimationConfig defaults conflict with AabSettings. (Affects S1 defaults_audit, S8.)
- D-005: :platform is currently kotlin("jvm"); becomes com.android.library in S3.
- D-006: 125 distinct %AAB_* variables (not 122 as older docs say).
- D-007: settings.gradle.kts has NO pluginManagement block → AGP unresolvable → gradle
  CONFIGURATION fails for every target, even pure-JVM `:domain:test` (verified 2026-06-11 with
  Gradle 8.14.3: "Plugin com.android.application 8.5.2 was not found"). The Codex build was
  never runnable. S3 must add `pluginManagement { repositories { google(); mavenCentral();
  gradlePluginPortal() } }` (or migrate plugin decls accordingly). Until S3: no gradle target
  works at all. (Affects S3; S4 is safe — it depends on S3.)

- D-008: D-004 RESOLVED (S1 `defaults_audit.md`). Canonical from task570: `AAB_AnimSteps=20`,
  `MinWait=25`, `MaxWait=65`, `Throttle=AnimSteps*MaxWait+10=1310`, `ThreshMidpoint=log10(Zone2End)=4`.
  `AAB_MaxSteps` is in the 125-var census but NEVER assigned a default → legacy/unused, do not invent
  one. The salvaged `AnimationConfig` defaults (50/5/30) are WRONG; use 20/25/65. Settings missing from
  `AabSettings.kt`: `AnimSteps`, `ContextOverride`, `SetupTitle` (+ derived `ThreshMidpoint`). Split:
  38 SETTING / 4 DERIVED (form2A/2D/3A, ThreshMidpoint) / 83 RUNTIME. (Affects S5, S8.)
- D-009: prof760 + prof758 multi-clause gates use Tasker `And2`/`Or2` sub-grouping; exact
  parenthesization (and polarity of `%AAB_MainLoop != On`) is UNRESOLVED — literal sequences captured
  in `extraction/profiles.md`, best-effort reading flagged. Validate against runtime in S9. `ThreshAbsLow/High`
  (prof760 abs gate) are written by task546 _Set Thresholds_, NOT task570. (Affects S9; informs S4.)
- D-010: Engine vs Tasker micro-divergences found in S1 spot-check (code left untouched, for S4/S5):
  (a) `BrightnessEngine.luxSmoothing` clamps `luxAlpha.coerceIn(0,1)` — task535 does NOT clamp;
  (b) `mapLuxToBrightness` wraps `^0.33` bases in `.coerceAtLeast(0.0)` — task661 does NOT. Dynamic-threshold
  sigmoid+dark branch is an EXACT match. (Affects S4 golden boundary rows, S5.)
- D-011: BRANCH DISCREPANCY. CLAUDE.md/RUNBOOK say work on `claude/modest-bohr-5ybl2i`, but this
  session's checked-out branch and push target is `claude/practical-mayer-kaopcf` (per session directive).
  S1 committed/pushed to `claude/practical-mayer-kaopcf`. Future sessions: confirm the intended branch;
  if the canonical branch is modest-bohr, these S1 docs may need to be merged/cherry-picked over.

- D-012: BRANCH DISCREPANCY continues. This S2 session ran on `claude/dreamy-brahmagupta-eqd4nu`
  (per session directive), not `claude/modest-bohr-5ybl2i` (CLAUDE.md) nor `claude/practical-mayer-kaopcf`
  (S1, D-011). Three branches now carry program docs. A future session MUST reconcile/merge these onto
  one canonical branch before code segments (S3+) build on them.
- D-013: SOLAR SOURCE RESOLVED (task90). Dynamic Scale COMPUTES sunrise/sunset/dawn/dusk/solar-noon
  ITSELF via inline NOAA solar equations (declination `0.39782*sin(L)`, `H=acos(cosH)`) from
  lat/lon/date — it does NOT consume Tasker `%SUNRISE`/`%SUNSET`. Polar: `cosH` out of [-1,1] →
  `AAB_SunStatus="polar"`, `ss_sunlight_duration=1440` (midnight sun, `-2.0` marker) else `0`. Normal:
  `durationMins=(set-rise)/60`, `+1440` if negative. **S6 must port a NOAA solar calculator**, not call
  any platform sunrise API; golden-test vs NOAA tables incl. polar. (Affects S6.)
- D-014: CONTEXT PRECEDENCE is NOT profile `<pri>` (prof762–768 are all pri 0). Real precedence = the
  per-rule integer `priority` inside `contexts.json`, resolved in task43 PASS 3: highest priority wins,
  ties → specificity (# matched trigger dimensions), final ties → array order. An override swaps the
  ENTIRE active profile via `_ProfileManager LOAD_FILE` (39-key snapshot) + re-runs Set Initial
  Brightness — NOT a scale-only/min-max-only modifier. Two caches: `%AAB_ContextCache`
  =`[BATT][LOC][WIFI],pkg,pkg,` (token gate + app set) and `%AAB_ContextJSONCache` (full JSON RAM copy);
  disk truth = `Download/AAB/configs/contexts.json`. Daily reset prof8→task26 fires 03:00, clears ONLY
  the JSON RAM cache (code 549), forcing disk reload. task43 has per-caller cooldowns
  (Resume 0 / Batt 30s / Loc 8s / Wifi 8s / Time 1s / else 500ms) + signal veto gates. (Affects S10; corrects feature spec §1.)
- D-015: FORMULA VALIDATION = 5 rules. task583 `_RedInvalidFormulae` (3 advisory, marks scene field red,
  no abort): `form2A<0`, `form3A<0`, `form2C>zone1End`. task707 `_ValidateBrightnessParams` (2 safety):
  predicts brightness at 1000 lux via the zone formula that 1000 lux falls in; if `<25` → warning toast +
  `%is_safe=no`; `%AAB_MaxBright` defaults 255 when unset. (Affects S8 `validate()`, S12 red-invalid UI.)
- D-016: PRIVILEGE DETECTION (task378) is a first-hit probe: Root(`su -c id`→uid0) → WriteSecure
  (`checkPermission`) → Shizuku(`getShizukuService`) → ADB-WiFi(TCP 127.0.0.1:5555) → None. ALL positive
  results map to ELEVATED; None = unprivileged overlay. BASIC (WRITE_SETTINGS) is a SEPARATE gate in
  task563 step 1. `%AAB_Privilege` cached unless caller forces re-detect; `%AAB_PermGranted="3"`=all 8
  runtime perms granted. task643 only TEACHES the `pm grant WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` adb command (clipboard
  dialog), never grants. (Affects S7 PrivilegeManager, S11 onboarding.)
- D-017: `%AAB_AnimSteps` HAS a user-facing slider (Misc Settings, range 0–100) and `%AAB_ScaleTaperMidpoint`
  a slider (Experiment Settings, 130–240) — confirms both are real settings (reinforces D-008: add AnimSteps
  to AabSettings). All numeric inputs in settings scenes are `EditTextElement` (no SliderElement in
  brightness/reactivity/superdimming); toggles render as overlaid Switch PAIRS (on+off overlay) → collapse
  to one M3 toggle. (Affects S8 schema, S12 UI.)
- D-018: Scene element census = exactly **450** raw `<*Element sr=>` (224 Rect/129 Text/28 Web/22 EditText/
  20 Properties/16 Switch/6 Slider/5 Button); ~264 are functional, the rest are nested `background` rects.
  `screen_map.md` dispositions all 450 (functional → target screen; background rects + PropertiesElement
  scene-chrome → dropped). 8 of 28 WebElements are Chart.js charts → named Compose charts; generators are
  NOT 1:1 with scene names (Experiment Graph uses task549/HTML_Graph4; Taper Graph uses task657/HTML_Graph5).
  Unresolved carried from features extraction: And2/Or2 grouping in task551 OFF-path branch (validate in S9).

- D-019: S3 revealed three pre-existing Codex compile bugs (no prior baseline was runnable due to D-007):
  (a) `BrightnessCurveConfig` was missing `zone1End: Double = 35.0` field used by `mapLuxToBrightness` —
  added with same default as `ThresholdConfig.zone1End`; S4/S5 must keep both fields in sync or unify.
  (b) `AmbientMonitoringService.kt` imported `com.tideo.autobrightness.app.R` but namespace is
  `com.tideo.autobrightness` → corrected to `com.tideo.autobrightness.R`.
  (c) `ProfileImportExportManager.kt` called `AabProfilePayload(settings.validate())` positionally but
  constructor is `(schemaVersion: Int, settings: AabSettings)` → fixed to named arg `(settings = …)`.
  Additionally: `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar` requires com.google.android.material (not in SDK
  alone) → used `android:Theme.Material.Light.NoActionBar` (SDK built-in) as XML parent for Compose app.
  Domain test `rapidLuxSpike_isSmoothedByTaskerFormula` fails: lux spike 20→800 gives luxAlpha=1.0
  (no smoothing), but test expects <1.0. Root cause: effectiveDelta ≈ 36.87 → exp(−66) ≈ 0 → alpha=1.
  This is a pre-existing engine parity bug per D-010; S4 will characterize it via reference impl; S5 fixes.
  Final version matrix: Kotlin 2.0.21, AGP 8.7.3, Compose BOM 2024.12.01, Gradle 8.14.3, minSdk 31,
  compileSdk/targetSdk 35. (Affects S4: note the domain compile fix; S5: fix engine parity.)
