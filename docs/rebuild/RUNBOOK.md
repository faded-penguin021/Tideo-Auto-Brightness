# RUNBOOK — maintenance playbook

The Tasker→Kotlin rebuild is **done and shipped** (v1.0.0). This is the entry point for
*changing* the app afterward while preserving Tasker feature parity. Pick the change-type
playbook that matches your task, read the reference docs it names, then do the work.

The full migration record (segment briefs, gate findings, ~96 deviations) is frozen in
`../history/` — consult it, don't extend it. **Code + golden vectors are ground truth**; where
any doc disagrees with the code, trust the code (and fix the doc).

## Where logic lives

- **`:domain`** — pure JVM/Kotlin. ALL math/decision logic (smoothing, threshold, curve
  mapping, scaling, animation planning). No Android imports. Golden-tested.
- **`:platform`** — Android library. Real system adapters behind small interfaces (light
  sensor, brightness/secure-dimming writers, PrivilegeManager, ContentObserver override
  detector, battery/wifi/location/foreground-app readers).
- **`:app`** — Compose M3 UI (~9 screens), DataStore settings (`AabSettings`), foreground
  service runtime, QS tile, boot receiver, notification.

## Reference-doc index (live, in `docs/rebuild/` unless noted)

| Question | Doc |
|---|---|
| What is every Tasker artifact and how was it dispositioned? | `PARITY_CHECKLIST.md` |
| End-to-end pipeline behavior (sensor→dimming) | `extraction/pipeline_spec.md` |
| A specific profile / gate's semantics | `extraction/profiles.md`, `extraction/contexts_spec.md` |
| A specific task's actions / curve math | `extraction/tasks/task<id>_*.md` |
| Default values & variable classification | `extraction/defaults_audit.md` |
| Ancillary features (tile, notification, debug, import/export) | `extraction/features_spec.md` |
| Anonymous scene-handler tasks | `extraction/tasks/anonymous_handlers.md` |
| Scene → M3 screen mapping | `screen_map.md`, `extraction/scenes/*` |
| How to safely re-read the source XML | `XML_RECIPES.md` |
| Known parity deviations / open gaps | `parity_gaps.md` |
| Privilege tiers / permissions / DataStore schema | `architecture/*` |
| Material 3 audit | `design/m3_audit.md` |
| Solved mistakes from the rebuild (⭐) | `../history/DEVIATIONS_LEDGER.md` |

## Change-type playbooks

Each: *when · read first · code to touch · parity obligations · acceptance · record it.*

### 1. Tasker profile added / changed / removed (a trigger context or pipeline gate)
- **Read first:** `extraction/profiles.md` (+ `contexts_spec.md` for context watchers); the
  relevant `DEVIATIONS_LEDGER` rows (profile gating, ConditionList semantics). Re-read the XML
  only via `XML_RECIPES.md`.
- **Code:** the hardcoded-boolean profile gates in `:domain`/`:platform` (no generic
  ConditionList evaluator exists — gates are explicit Kotlin booleans with a truth-table test).
- **Parity:** ConditionList semantics — plain And/Or bind tighter than And2/Or2; XML children
  are alphabetical (re-sort numerically). Preserve the single-coroutine, drop-on-reentry model.
- **Acceptance:** update the gate truth-table test; run the ladder below.
- **Record:** flip the row in `PARITY_CHECKLIST.md`; note the change in `STATE.md`.

### 2. Tasker task added / changed / removed (pipeline / curve math)
- **Read first:** `extraction/tasks/task<id>_*.md` + `extraction/pipeline_spec.md`; cross-check
  `defaults_audit.md` for any variables involved.
- **Code:** the corresponding `:domain` engine logic + its golden tests.
- **Parity:** port behavior EXACTLY incl. odd rounding (`round3`, `Math.round` tie-toward-+∞,
  BigDecimal HALF_UP, string-formatted numbers). For Variable Set (code 547) maths, follow the
  transcription protocol: cross-validate `task661` vs `task663`; **disagreements → `parity_gaps.md`,
  never guess.** Golden vectors are immutable — production conforms to them.
- **Acceptance:** golden/JVM tests green.
- **Record:** add a provenance comment (`// Tasker: task<id> "<name>" XML L<line>`); update
  `PARITY_CHECKLIST.md` + `STATE.md`.

### 3. Tasker scene added / changed / removed (a screen)
- **Read first:** `screen_map.md` + the matching `extraction/scenes/*.md` + `design/m3_audit.md`.
- **Code:** the Compose screen in `:app`; settings via `AabSettings`/DataStore.
- **Parity:** keep user-facing behavior/labels faithful; honor the scene→screen consolidation
  matrix rather than reintroducing one-scene-per-screen.
- **Acceptance:** `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, `:app:assembleDebug`, `:app:lintDebug`.
- **Record:** update `screen_map.md` + `PARITY_CHECKLIST.md` + `STATE.md`.

### 4. Bug fix
- **Read first:** the reference doc for the affected area (above) + any related
  `DEVIATIONS_LEDGER` row.
- **Steps:** reproduce → add/adjust a failing test first → fix so it conforms to the golden
  vectors (never edit a golden vector to pass; changing one needs proof the extraction was
  wrong + a `STATE.md` entry) → run the ladder.
- **Record:** `STATE.md` (and `parity_gaps.md` if it was a parity gap).

### 5. Tasker-independent feature (rare — no parity source)
- No golden reference exists; still obey the coding conventions in `CLAUDE.md` and add tests.
- **Record:** note the deviation-from-Tasker explicitly in `STATE.md`.

## Acceptance ladder

Run the relevant subset until green (on-device behavior is owner-verified — no emulator, no KVM):

```bash
./gradlew :domain:test            # pure-JVM engine + golden parity tests
./gradlew :platform:test          # Robolectric adapter tests
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest  # app unit + Robolectric tests
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug      # APK
./gradlew :app:lintDebug          # lint vs frozen baseline
```

## Self-adaptation — keep this runbook useful

If this runbook lacks what you need for the task in front of you:
1. Consult the live reference docs above and `../history/` (esp. `DEVIATIONS_LEDGER.md`).
2. If you learn a durable fact future sessions need, append it to `STATE.md` (and/or correct
   the relevant reference doc — provenance-stamped, terse).
3. If a playbook here is wrong, stale, or missing a case you just handled, **fix this RUNBOOK in
   the same change.** Treat the runbook as code: it should always reflect how changes are
   actually made now.
