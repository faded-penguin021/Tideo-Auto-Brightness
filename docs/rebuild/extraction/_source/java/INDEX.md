# Embedded-Java extracts (reference transcripts — NOT buildable)

These 40 `*.java.txt` files are the verbatim embedded-Java blocks (Tasker action **code 474**) pulled
from the Tasker export `Advanced_Auto_Brightness_V3.3.prj_9.xml`, `html.unescape`-decoded from their
XML-entity-encoded `arg0` source. They are **reference transcripts only**:

- They are **not compilable Java**. Tasker substitutes `%AAB_*` variable *values* textually into the
  source before compiling, and the surrounding Tasker scaffolding (scene/var context) is absent. The
  reference implementation in `domain/src/test` parameterizes those `%var` sigils — see `TaskerReference.kt`.
- The `.txt` suffix (added in S12.9a) keeps them out of any Java/Kotlin toolchain and signals
  "documentation, not source". They previously lived at `docs/rebuild/extraction/java/*.java`.
- Naming: `task<id>_<block#>_<slug>.java.txt`. A few tasks have two blocks (e.g. `task90_1`/`task90_2`,
  `task618_1`/`task618_2`, `task630/631/663`).

**Cross-validation rule (CLAUDE.md):** `task663` (`_GenerateGraph`) holds a plot-side copy of the
3-zone formula — cross-validate against it, never port from it. `task661` ("Map Lux to Brightness")
contains NO Java; its curve math is in code-547 maths expressions, not here.
